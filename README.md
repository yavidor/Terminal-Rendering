# Terminal-Rendering
Trying out rendering in the terminal
Current goal is real time latex rendering, perhaps even as a neovim plugin

## TODOs
- [X] Render the mandelbrot set
- [ ] Resize images (make them smaller mostly)
- [ ] Render latex without tears (Both kind of tears)
- [X] Maybe GIF?
